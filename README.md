<h2/>Purpose and original interest</h2>
</div>
Previously, I have worked as Food Development Technologist in food industry. At that time, I need to develop multiple recipes for different projects and keep track of the recipe changes through time. One challenge I have encountered is lack of tools to keep track of these recipes. At that time, my only tool is excel and I have created multiple sheets under one excel which is very inconvenient. Therefore, I want to develop a webapp to replace my old excel sheet.
